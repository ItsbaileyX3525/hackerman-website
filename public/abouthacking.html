            <h2>What is hacking?</h2>
            <p>Hacking is the act of exploiting a computer system or network to gain unauthorized access to data or systems. It can be used for both ethical and unethical purposes.</p>
            <p>Unethical hacking such as doing hacking without permissions is illegal as you may have guessed and falls under the GDPR and computer misuse act which can cost you a rather pretty penny if caught.</p>
            <p>Ethical hacking is the act of exploiting a computer system or network to gain unauthorized access to data or systems with permission from the owner. This is often done to identify and fix security vulnerabilities.</p>

            <h2>Why do people hack?</h2>
            <p>Well as explained before, people hack for various reasons, some good, some bad however for most cases its for the money, hacking ethically means that you have been hired too do so and therefore you get paid where as hacking unethically means your doing it to likely collect company data and sell it off.</p>
            <p>Ethical hackers will be hired by companies to carry off varying tests to see if the hacker can break into the systems, they do this so if they do find any security issues they can report it and then have the issue fixed as fast as possible so an unethical hacker cannot do the same thing.</p>
            <p>Unethical hackers, they are no good! They will hack companies any chance they got so they can steal company data and sell it online for a profit, this hurts the company and the people who use it as the company loses repuatation and all your details have been leaked online! You can check if your passwords or emails have been by going to <a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/">Have I Been Pwned</a> where you can see all <text-data style="font-weight: bold;">known</text-data> leaks</p>

            <h2>A little history of hacking.</h2>
            <p>
            Hacking has been around since the early days of computing, with the term "hacker" originally referring to someone who enjoyed exploring and tinkering with computer systems. However, as computers became more widespread, the term began to take on a more negative connotation, particularly with the rise of cybercrime in the 1990s.</p>
            <p>In the early days of the internet, hacking was often seen as a way to push the boundaries of technology and explore new possibilities. However, as the internet became more commercialized, hacking began to be associated with criminal activity, such as identity theft and data breaches.</p>
            <p>Today, hacking is a complex and multifaceted field, with both ethical and unethical hackers working to exploit vulnerabilities in computer systems and networks. While some hackers use their skills for malicious purposes, others work to improve security and protect against cyber threats.</p>
